# Project Scenario 

Mint Classics Company, a retailer of classic model cars and other vehicles, is looking at closing one of their storage facilities. 

To support a data-based business decision, they are looking for suggestions and recommendations for reorganizing or reducing inventory, while still maintaining timely service to their customers. For example, they would like to be able to ship a product to a customer within 24 hours of the order being placed.

## Project Objectives

1. Explore products currently in inventory.

2. Determine important factors that may influence inventory reorganization/reduction.

3. Provide analytic insights and data-driven recommendations.

## Goal

The goal is find answers to the following question in order to address the needs for inventory reduction and closing up of warehouses

1) Where are items stored and if they were rearranged, could a warehouse be eliminated?

2) How are inventory numbers related to sales figures? Do the inventory counts seem appropriate for each item?

3) Are we storing items that are not moving? Are any items candidates for being dropped from the product line?

-------------------------------------------------------------

## The following data are produced using SQL queries:

I. Total quantity of items in each warehouse

|  warehouseCode  |	totalQuantity |
|  :---------:    |  :--------:|
|  a		          |	131688 |
|  b		          |	219183 |
|  c		          |	124880 |
|  d		          |	79380  |

According to the table above, Warehouses A and C have similar quantity level of 131,688 and 124,880 respectively. 

While Warehouse B have the most quantity at 219,183, Warehouse D has the least quantity at 79,380.

**<ins> Solution for eliminating one warehouse </ins>** is to remove warehouse D and distribute its warehouse item across the other three warehouses

Though these are some of the following issues to consider when considering eliminating warehouses:
- The capacity of the other warehouses to store additional items
- The cost of moving items from one warehouse to another
-  The types of items stored in Warehouse D and whether they can be appropriately stored in the other warehouses
- The impact on delivery times to customers

II. Total quantity ordered and current quantity in stock for each product.

|S12_3148	  |	1969 Corvair Monza			              |	6906		|	963|
|S12_3380	  |	1968 Dodge Charger			              |	9123		|	925|
|S12_3891	  |	1969 Ford Falcon			                |	1049		|	965|
|S12_3990	  |	1970 Plymouth Hemi Cuda			          |	5663		|	900|
|S12_4473	  |	1957 Chevy Pickup			                |	6125		|	1056|
|S12_4675	  |	1969 Dodge Charger			              |	7323		|	992|
..... 

According to the data above, we can observe that the quantity that the customer ordered are almost always significant less than the quantity in stock.

For example, some product such as "2002 Suzuki XREO" has only sold 1019 units, but there are still almost 10,000 units in stocks. There are 10x more inventory than the company can sell.

Other products that do not have this issues are constant needs of supply in stocks. One example would be "1968 Ford Mustang" are in critical need of restock in order to sell.

At one hand, the data concludes that the company has more stocks than it can sell, thus we can see the issue of **overstocking** or the product is not selling well. On the other, there are product that need supplies.

**<ins> One solution to overstocking </ins>** is to reduce the inventory of specific products. 

Not only that, the column "totalQuantOrdered" for the above table only covered ordered unit, so there is no information on the status of it (e.g, if it actually shipped or cancelled, or other reason). 

III. Number of order not shipped for all reason vs cancelled only.

From the Table II, here is the following data in comparison with the first line of Table III:

|productCode	|	productName				          |	quantityInStock	|	totalQuantOrdered|
| :-------------: |:-------------:| :-----: | :--------: 
S18_3029	|1999 Yamaha Speed Boat	|4259	|966

For this particular order, we can see that there 21% of the order is not shipped and have to stay in the warehouse or stocks. 

Since the Table II is ordered descently, we can assume at most 21% of the order would not be shipped and have to stay in inventory for quite sometime.
